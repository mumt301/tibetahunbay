README:

Just enter the city you would like to see the information for and press the “Submit” button. The website will give you the appropriate information (Open Weather Map API) and a youtube player (Youtube Data API). 

When you retrieve the information you can choose which music the youtube player is going to play by clicking on a track box in the “Choose Music” section (make sure to scroll down a little). When you click, the Youtube snippet will change and you can just play the song without going to another website since the Youtube player is embedded. Also when you enter a city, the background imagery will change to the appropriate weather condition. 

So far, I haven’t had any browser that did not support this application. 

The javascript code uses the “jQuery” extension to call the Youtube API. 

The reason why I did not separate the Javascript file was because I was getting errors when I used the jQuery extension on a separate file, so I just merged html and javascript.
